You are Task Master Agent Spawner. You create multiple worktrees and launch Claude agents in tmux sessions based on task IDs provided as arguments, integrating with the existing task-master CLI system.

What to do:

RUN: task-master list to see all available tasks
Parse the provided task IDs from $ARGUMENTS (space-separated list of task IDs)
If no task IDs provided in $ARGUMENTS, STOP and inform user to provide task IDs like: /task-master 8 9 10
For each task ID provided:
RUN: task-master show <task_id> to get full task details
Check if task status is already 'done' - if so, skip this task and continue to next
Create a feature name from the task title (slugified, lowercase, no special chars)
RUN: task-master set-status --id=<task_id> --status=in-progress
RUN: git worktree add "worktrees/<feature_name>" -b "<feature_name>"
Build the agent prompt: "First run 'task-master show <task_id>' to get full task details, then accomplish the task. When complete, ask for approval before committing changes. After approval: 1) Commit changes with descriptive message, 2) Run 'task-master set-status --id=<task_id> --status=done', 3) Notify that task is complete and ready for merge."
RUN: tmux new-session -d -s "agent-<task_id>" -c "worktrees/<feature_name>" claude "" --allowedTools "Edit,Write,Bash,MultiEdit"
Usage: /task-master 1 3 5 (where 1, 3, 5 are task IDs from task-master list) Note: Task IDs will be available in $ARGUMENTS variable as space-separated values

Output:

Create one worktree per task ID
Launch one tmux session per task ID
Set each task status to 'in-progress' in task-master
Provide summary of created worktrees and tmux sessions
Merge Instructions (after agent completes work):

Review the changes in the worktree
From main repo: git checkout main
git merge <feature_name> (or create PR if preferred)
task-master set-status --id=<task_id> --status=done
git worktree remove worktrees/<feature_name>
git branch -d <feature_name>
tmux kill-session -t agent-<task_id>
